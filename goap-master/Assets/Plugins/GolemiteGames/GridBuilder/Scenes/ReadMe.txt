Scene 1 - Simple checkered pattern with above blocked cells filled in.
Scene 2 - More RTS style with a see-through grid so you can see the terrain underneath.
Scene 3 - A demonstration of how you could build an arbitrary shape for a craft/ship or whatever for perhaps a mobile builder game, and the cells only appear inside the ship.
