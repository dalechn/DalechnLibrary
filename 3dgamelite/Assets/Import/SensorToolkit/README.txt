Thank you for purchasing SensorToolkit 2!

The documentation is available online at: http://www.micosmo.com/sensortoolkit2
There are some example scenes inside Examples/ directory. I recommend first viewing the 'Fundamentals' scene.

If you have any questions, feature requests or if you have found a bug then please send me an email at micosmogames@gmail.com


[CHANGELOG]
2.0.1 - No functional changes. Improved formatting and comments of all the sensors code.
2.0.2 - Removed a List.AddRange which had slipped through and caused GC.
2.0.3 - Bugfix for LOSSensor so it will generate proper test points on rotated objects.
